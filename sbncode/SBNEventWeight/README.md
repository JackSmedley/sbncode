SBN Event Weighting
===================
The `SBNEventWeight` package calculates a set of weights attached to art
events, including the BNB flux (an implementation based on the MiniBooNE flux
model), GENIE interaction model systematics (using GENIE ReWeight via nutools),
and additional systematic uncertainties (e.g. cross section ratio uncertainties
due to second-class currents).

This package began from a clone of the larsim and ubsim EventWeight modules and
calculators, for specialization to SBN systematics.

Authors: The `EventWeight` framework and calculators were initially developed
by the MicroBooNE collaboration with contributions from Raquel Castillo
Fernandez, Marco Del Tutto, Joseph Zennamo, Ariana Hackenburg, Adam Lister,
Andy Mastbaum, Herb Greenlee, Kirsty Duffy, Steven Gardiner, Lauren Yates,
and Wes Ketchum. The framework was ported into larsim by Marco Del Tutto.
